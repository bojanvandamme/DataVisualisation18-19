Assignment 5

Million Dollar BILL
Process
I found a dataset online which showed the top 100 richest people in the world. 
I wanted to created something in Node Box again, 
so i played with it until I came to a visualisation I liked. 
I then thought of making it into a Dollar Bill, as an extra "fun for the eyes" look. 
So I designed a simple dollar bill and placed my Node Box data visualisation in it. 
And in the end, since Bill Gates is the richest, I came up with the name "The Million Dollar BILL".
