Assignment 3

Process
I started by making it possible to store the amount of each typed letter with the letter. 
After this I created a basic bar chart with a bar for each letter. 
Eventually I made it look like the barchart filled up big A's, B's, C's,... .

Goal
Have an interactive website, where there is a visualisation of the amount of A's, B's, C's,... 
you have typed in that text.

Properties
Intent: A.1 Exploratory

Other: A.x D3

Result
Assignment 3 is a website where when a person types in a textbox, 
the amount of times a certain letter is typed gets visualised.
