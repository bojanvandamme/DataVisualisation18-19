Assignment 4

Process
I wanted to do something with the sizes of different LEGO sets. 
So I found a dataset online with all the LEGO sets created since 1949 with the amount of bricks of each.

I then imported this CSV file into Node Box and created a visualisation that goes over every year, 
and visualises the top 5 biggest boxes. After that I exported all the needed images 
of a range from 1949-2019. I then created a Premiere Pro sequence which resulted in my slow video.

In my opinion the slow video was too slow to compare the amount of bricks over the years, 
but faster would be unreadable. So I created a second video. 
In this video the extra information isn't there to distract 
and the video can play faster to visualise the increase of sizes.

Goal
Create a linear video which compares the amount of bricks in LEGO sets for every year 
since the start of LEGO.

Properties
Intent: A.1 Explanatory

Appearance: A.2 Linear

Other: A.x Node-based

Result
Assignment 4 are 2 videos, which show 5 of the biggest LEGO sets for each year, 
starting when LEGO first began in 1949 up until 2019. And compares their amount of bricks. 
One video is a fast video, to compare the amount, the other is a slower video so you can read information about each set.
