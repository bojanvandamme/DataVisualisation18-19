How to Make Node Box Files Work

Because the date filter-data node is linked to the frames node, 
the data shown will depend on the frame number seen on the bottom left of Node Box.
since my dataset starts at 1949 you have to change that frame count to 1949 to see the first date,
and go up to see the other dates up until 2019.
