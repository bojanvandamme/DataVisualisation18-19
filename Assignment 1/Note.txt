Assignment 1

Process
I wanted to do something with space, so I looked for certain space crafts in space
 and found a lot of famous ones were located in the LEO, Low Earth Orbit. 
So I calculated all the distances for on a poster, and drew them in comparison to Earth.

This was not good enough for the teacher so I also compared all the data to the distance to the moon. 
Since this was impossible to place on 2 posters, but rather 322. 
We decided to make the other 320 pages to be put down as a bundle.

Goal
Visualise the distances of different space crafts in low earth orbit compared to each other and Earth 
(and later also the Moon).

Properties
Intent: A.1 Explanatory

Appearance: A.2 Static

Result
Assignment 1 is a visualisation of the distance between different space crafts in Low Earth Orbit, 
compared to Earth and the Moon.
