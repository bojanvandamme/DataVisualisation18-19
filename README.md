## Assignment 1
#### Process
I wanted to do something with space, so I looked for certain space crafts in space and found a lot of famous ones were located in the LEO, Low Earth Orbit. So I calculated all the distances for on a poster, and drew them in comparison  to Earth.

This was not good enough for the teacher so I also compared all the data to the distance to the moon. Since this was impossible to place on 2 posters, but rather 322. We decided to make the other 320 pages to be put down as a bundle.

#### Goal
Visualise the distances of different space crafts in low earth orbit compared to  each other and Earth (and later also the Moon).

#### Properties
Intent: A.1 Explanatory

Appearance: A.2 Static

#### Result
Assignment 1 is a visualisation of the distance between different space crafts in Low Earth Orbit, compared to Earth and the Moon.

## Assignment 2
#### Process
I wanted to see if you could visually see an image, when it was made in 3D, and the height was determined by the R,G or B value. I first started with finding how I could split an image into it's 3 color channels. This was possible in Photoshop so i ended up with 3 different 30x32 images.

I then manually raised every pixel in fusion 360 according to the value I got with the eyedropper tool in Photoshop. This I did with the first 5 lines of the image, to have a prototype to show the teacher. He then advised me not to do it manually, but write a Python code and use Blender.

I then did all the other colors using this method, generating row after row according to an array. The arrays I still had to make by hand with Photoshop.

#### Goal
Have 3 different prints, of each color channel, where the difference between them is visible.

#### Properties
Intent: A.1 Exploratory

Media: B Physical

Appearance: A.2 Static

Other: A.x 3D

#### Result
Assignment 2 is a visualisation of a low resolution picture, which I have seperated into the 3 color channels. R G and B each have their own 3D model, the height of each pixel represents the amount of Red, Green or Blue in that pixel.

## Assignment 3
#### Process
I started by making it possible to store the amount of each typed letter with the letter. After this I created a basic bar chart with a bar for each letter. Eventually I made it look like the barchart filled up big A's, B's, C's,... .

#### Goal
Have an interactive website, where there is a visualisation of the amount of A's, B's, C's,... you have typed in that text.

#### Properties
Intent: A.1 Exploratory

Appearance: A.2 Interactive

Other: A.x D3

#### Result
Assignment 3 is a website where when a person types in a textbox, the amount of times a certain letter is typed gets visualised.

## Assignment 4
#### Process
I wanted to do something with the sizes of different LEGO sets. So I found a dataset online with all the LEGO sets created since 1949 with the amount of bricks of each.

I then imported this CSV file into Node Box and created a visualisation that goes over every year, and visualises the top 5 biggest boxes. After that I exported all the needed images of a range from 1949-2019. I then created a Premiere Pro sequence which resulted in my slow video. 

In my opinion the slow video was too slow to compare the amount of bricks over the years, but faster would be unreadable. So I created a second video. In this video the extra information isn't there to distract and the video can play faster to visualise the increase of sizes.

#### Goal
Create a linear video which compares the amount of bricks in LEGO sets for every year since the start of LEGO.

#### Properties
Intent: A.1 Explanatory

Appearance: A.2 Linear

Other: A.x Node-based

#### Result
Assignment 4 are 2 videos, which show 5 of the biggest LEGO sets for each year, starting when LEGO first began in 1949 up until 2019. And compares their amount of bricks. One video is a fast video, to compare the amount, the other is a slower video so you can read information about each set.

## Assignment 5
### Million Dollar BILL
#### Process
I found a dataset online which showed the top 100 richest people in the world. I wanted to created something in Node Box again, so i played with it until I came to a visualisation I liked. I then thought of making it into a Dollar Bill, as an extra "fun for the eyes" look. So I designed a simple dollar bill and placed my Node Box data visualisation in it. And in the end, since Bill Gates is the richest, I came up with the name "The Million Dollar BILL".

#### Goal
Make a data visualisation which compares the top 100 richest people.

#### Properties
Intent: A.1 Exploratory

Appearance: A.2 Static

Other: A.x Node-based

#### Result

Assignment 5 is a visualisation that compares the top 100 richest people in the world.
