Assignment 2

Process
I wanted to see if you could visually see an image, when it was made in 3D, 
and the height was determined by the R,G or B value. 
I first started with finding how I could split an image into it's 3 color channels. 
This was possible in Photoshop so i ended up with 3 different 30x32 images.

I then manually raised every pixel in fusion 360 according to the value 
I got with the eyedropper tool in Photoshop. This I did with the first 5 lines of the image, 
to have a prototype to show the teacher. He then advised me not to do it manually, 
but write a Python code and use Blender.

I then did all the other colors using this method, generating row after row according to an array. 
The arrays I still had to make by hand with Photoshop.

Goal
Have 3 different prints, of each color channel, where the difference between them is visible.

Properties
Intent: A.1 Exploratory

Media: B Physical

Appearance: A.2 Static

Other: A.x 3D

Result
Assignment 2 is a visualisation of a low resolution picture, 
which I have seperated into the 3 color channels. R G and B each have their own 3D model, 
the height of each pixel represents the amount of Red, Green or Blue in that pixel.
